= A Curious Offer

Our coalition is in trouble. The right-leaning members of the DVP are constantly criticizing us for our policies, and are threatening to call a vote of no confidence to collapse this government[? if spd_prussia :, or to do the same for our government in the state of Prussia ?]. However, thanks to our good relations with Zentrum, Heinrich Brüning has offered to help us reduce this wave of dissent.
  

- @zentrum_resource: Ask Brüning to contribute resources in a monetary appeasement. 
- @negotiation : Brüning offers to mediate in our favor to President Hindenburg, who in turn will appease his far-right friends. Considering the President's far right positions, we aren't sure why he could side with us. However, Brüning claims to have a certain degree of influence over the President.
- @no_change: Refuse his help. We don't need a bourgeois leader's assistance!
- @easy_discard

on-arrival: resources: -= 1; coalition_affairs_timer = 5; coalition_dissent -= 1

Zentrum and SPD both offer monetary resources to appease our coalition partners. Some may call it bribery, but we call it Maintenance of Stability.

@negotiation
subtitle: It is an unorthodox plan, but it may just be what we need.
on-arrival: coalition_affairs_timer = 5; coalition_dissent -= 5

Heinrich Brüning will meet the President on Friday evening. We can only pray to Reichsführer Otto Braun that he succeeds.

@no_change
on-arival: left_dissent -= 8

We do not desire help from the enemy.
